# Graph Network Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive real-time dashboard for analyzing The Graph Network's query fees vs indexer rewards with enhanced data from the Graph Network subgraph.

## üöÄ Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Data Sources
- **Upgraded to Comprehensive Graph Network Subgraph**: Replaced generic subgraph queries with the official Graph Network mainnet subgraph (`graphprotocol/graph-network-mainnet`)
- **Rich Network Metrics**: Now includes detailed metrics like:
  - Total indexer query fees collected and rebates
  - Delegator query fee rebates
  - Curator query fees
  - Protocol taxes and unclaimed rebates
  - Indexer vs delegator indexing rewards breakdown
  - Active vs total counts for all network participants
  - Total tokens staked, allocated, delegated, and signalled

### Enhanced Indexer Analysis
- **Comprehensive Indexer Data**: Each indexer now shows:
  - Allocated and delegated tokens
  - Available stake and token capacity
  - Own stake ratio vs delegated stake ratio
  - Indexing reward cut and query fee cut percentages
  - Allocation count and forced closures
  - Query fee rebates and delegator query fees

### Enhanced Subgraph Analysis
- **Detailed Subgraph Metrics**: Each subgraph now displays:
  - Staked and signalled tokens
  - Signal amount and price per share
  - Reserve ratio and curation bonding curve data
  - Query fee rebates and curator fee rewards
  - Subgraph count and active subgraph count

### Network Health Indicators
- **Active Participants**: Shows active vs total counts for indexers, delegators, curators, and subgraphs
- **Staking Metrics**: Total staked, allocated, and delegated tokens
- **Network Status**: Mature vs growing network indicators based on query fee percentage

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
The dashboard uses the comprehensive Graph Network subgraph with enhanced GraphQL queries:

```typescript
// Network metrics with 20+ additional fields
export const NETWORK_METRICS_QUERY = `
  query {
    graphNetworks(first: 1) {
      totalIndexingRewards
      totalQueryFees
      totalIndexerQueryFeesCollected
      totalIndexerQueryFeeRebates
      totalDelegatorQueryFeeRebates
      totalCuratorQueryFees
      totalTaxedQueryFees
      totalUnclaimedQueryFeeRebates
      totalIndexingDelegatorRewards
      totalIndexingIndexerRewards
      indexerCount
      stakedIndexersCount
      delegatorCount
      activeDelegatorCount
      curatorCount
      activeCuratorCount
      subgraphCount
      activeSubgraphCount
      subgraphDeploymentCount
      totalTokensStaked
      totalTokensAllocated
      totalDelegatedTokens
      totalTokensSignalled
    }
  }
`;
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Graph Network Subgraph Endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/graph-network-mainnet
```

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Key Metrics Cards
- **Total Indexing Rewards**: Network-wide inflation rewards
- **Total Query Fees**: Organic revenue from queries
- **Rewards:Fees Ratio**: Network subsidy level indicator
- **Network Status**: Mature vs growing network classification
- **Active Indexers**: Currently staked indexers
- **Active Delegators**: Currently delegating participants
- **Active Subgraphs**: Currently active subgraphs
- **Total Staked**: Total GRT staked in the network

### Visualizations
- **Network Distribution Pie Chart**: Indexing rewards vs query fees breakdown
- **Historical Trends Area Chart**: Rewards/fees ratio over time
- **Top Indexers by Efficiency**: Revenue efficiency ranking with profile images
- **Top Subgraphs Bar Chart**: Query fees vs indexing rewards with images

### Enhanced Data Display
- **ENS Resolution**: Human-readable names for addresses
- **Profile Images**: Indexer and subgraph profile pictures
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed breakdowns for all network participants
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data from The Graph Network
